# Jeremy Ashley's Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Introduction

Hello! This is the README for My's first coding project, a Tic-Tac-Toe game created using vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM). This project marks an exciting milestone in my coding journey, showcasing my early programming skills and passion for web development.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name:** [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://tictactoebyjc.netlify.app/)
- **Created By:** [Jeremy Ashley](https://jcashleyportfolio.netlify.app/)
- **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/Messyginger0804/Arcade.git

## Project Description

This Tic-Tac-Toe game is a web-based implementation of the classic game. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols ('X' and 'O'). The game's primary goal is to provide an engaging and interactive experience for users while demonstrating my initial grasp of web development fundamentals.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay, where players take turns.
- Interactive game board with responsive design.
- Real-time feedback on the game's progress and outcome.
- Fun and visually appealing user interface.
- Suitable for players of all ages and skill levels.

## How to Play

To play this Tic-Tac-Toe game, simply follow these steps:

1. Open the game in a web browser by visiting the provided URL or running the HTML file.

2. Two players can take turns marking empty spaces on the 3x3 grid by clicking on them.

3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

4. If all spaces on the grid are filled, and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

- HTML: For structuring the game interface.
- CSS: For styling the game board and user interface.
- JavaScript: To implement the game logic and manipulate the DOM.
